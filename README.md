# Selector Generator

A browser-based tool that generates robust CSS and XPath selectors for automated UI testing. Built to support multiple testing frameworks and languages with a flexible set of options.

## Features

- Paste any **target HTML element** to generate selectors.
- (Optional) Provide full **DOM context** to build full-path selectors.
- Supports multiple testing frameworks:
  - Playwright
  - Selenium
  - Cypress
  - Puppeteer
  - WebdriverIO
- Supports multiple programming languages:
  - JavaScript
  - Python
  - Java
  - C#
- Generates and displays three types of selectors:
  - **Best Selector**: Chooses the most reliable option (e.g., `id`, `data-test-id`, or minimal unique path).
  - **CSS Selector**
  - **XPath Selector**
- Copy each selector to clipboard with a single click.
- Option to **avoid dynamic class names** (e.g., those starting with `sc-`, `tw-`, or long hashes).
- Option to **prefer text content** in selectors for better readability.
- Option to **prefer deepest matching element** when there are multiple matches.
- Option to **build selector from root of the document** or just relative to the matched element.
- Fully client-side — no dependencies, no uploads, no frameworks.

## How to Use

1. Paste the HTML of the element you want to target in the **Target Element** box.
2. (Optional) Paste the full HTML of the page in the **Full DOM** box.
3. Choose your **framework** and **language** from the dropdowns.
4. Adjust preferences:
   - Avoid dynamic classes
   - Use text content in selector
   - Prefer most deeply nested match
   - Build selector from document root
5. Click **Generate Selector**.
6. Copy the **Best**, **CSS**, or **XPath** selector using the buttons below the results.

## Example Use Case

You're writing a Playwright test in JavaScript. You paste in a button’s HTML snippet and optionally the surrounding DOM. The tool returns:

- **Best Selector**: `#submitBtn`
- **CSS Selector**: `div.form > button#submitBtn`
- **XPath Selector**: `/html/body/div[2]/form/button[1]`

Use the output directly in your automation script.
